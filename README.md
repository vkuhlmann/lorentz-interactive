# Lorentz interactive

Lorentz interactive is an interactive spacetime diagram for the 1D Lorentz transformations. Play around and gain insight!
Feel free to fork the project and make your improvements to it! A lot of the code is not really tidied up, but I only had
limited time to make this project, and it was also my first Javascript project.
The website is hosted at <https://vkuhlmann.github.io/lorentz-interactive/>.
